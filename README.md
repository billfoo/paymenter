## Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 24 Server**
  - A fresh installation is recommended for best compatibility.
- **Domain Name (Optional)**
  - A domain is required if you choose to enable SSL.
- **Root Privileges**
  - The script requires sudo or root access to install packages and configure services.

## Usage

### 1. Download the Script

```

### 2. Run the Script

Make the script executable and run it with sudo:

- **SSL Option**: Whether to install SSL with Certbot for HTTPS access.

### 4. Access Paymenter

## Script Walkthrough

This script performs the following actions:

1. **Updates and Installs System Dependencies**
   - Installs PHP 8.2, MySQL, Redis, Nginx, and necessary PHP extensions.
   
2. **Configures MySQL**
   - Sets up a `paymenter` database and user, securing MySQL with the provided password.

3. **Downloads Paymenter and Configures Nginx**
   - Downloads the latest version of Paymenter, sets up directory permissions, and configures an Nginx server block.

4. **Optional SSL Setup**
   - If selected, installs SSL using Certbot and configures Nginx for HTTPS.

5. **Environment and Migrations**
   - Sets up `.env` with your database credentials, runs database migrations, and seeds initial data.

6. **Cron Job and Queue Worker**
   - Configures a cron job for scheduled tasks and sets up a systemd service for the queue worker.

## Example Output

Upon successful completion, youâ€™ll see:

```
Paymenter installation complete! Access Paymenter at http://your_domain_or_ip or https://your_domain if SSL was enabled.
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Firewall**:
   - Ensure HTTP and HTTPS traffic are allowed through the firewall:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
     ```

2. **Service Status**:
   - If you encounter issues, check the status of relevant services:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     sudo systemctl status mariadb
     sudo systemctl status paymenter.service
     ```

3. **Error in Nginx Configuration**:
   - The script tests the Nginx configuration before reloading. If an error occurs, check `/etc/nginx/sites-available/paymenter.conf` and correct any issues.

4. **Database Connection**:
   - Ensure the MySQL service is running, and check the database credentials in `/var/www/paymenter/.env`.
